# Acknowledgements

This application was built on top of the [simulator](https://github.com/dmishin/hyperbolic-ca-simulator#cellular-automata-on-hyperbolic-fields) made by GitHub user [dmishin](https://github.com/dmishin), which is under the [MIT license](https://github.com/dmishin/hyperbolic-ca-simulator/blob/master/LICENSE.MIT).

# Project Details

This simulator was created as a course requirement for CS 198/199 (Special Project I & II) of the [Department of Computer Science](https://dcs.upd.edu.ph/), [University of the Philippines - Diliman](https://upd.edu.ph/) for AY 2023-2024.

<!--
Simulator of cellular automata on regular hyperbolic plane tilings, working in browser.

[See it online](http://dmishin.github.io/hyperbolic-ca-simulator/index.html)

For usage details, see [help page](http://dmishin.github.io/hyperbolic-ca-simulator/help.html)

Key features are:

- Support of arbitrary regular tilings.
- Unlimited world size

# Building

Build requirements are: Node.JS, NPM, GNU Make.
Install NPM modules: coffee-script, browserify, coffeeify.

# Testing

Running tests additionally requires the following NPM modules: mocha

```bash
$ make test
```

# Requirements

Works in any contemporary browser: Firefox, Chromium. Probably, works in the latest IE.

Upload animation feature works only if the page is open from the local server. To do it, Python 3 is additionally required. Change to the project direcory, build it (alternatively, download [index.html](http://dmishin.github.io/hyperbolic-ca-simulator/index.html) and [application.js](http://dmishin.github.io/hyperbolic-ca-simulator/application.js) from the demo site), then run:

```bash
$ python http_server_with_upload.py
```

After this, open http://localhost:8000/index.html and upload feature should work.

# Known bugs

### Change to generic rule, then change grid, then change back to binary

Workaround: set rule manually again.
